# ‚ú® ZEEKIT CODING CHALLENGE ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-FINISHED-brightgreen)

The goal of the game is to guess a TV show's name. 
The player will see a placeholder for a TV name with some missing letters. The player should guess and fill in the TV show's name. If the player guesses successfully a tv show name, it gets a point and moves forward to guess another tv show name. 
The player would be able to use a hint feature in case it's stuck with a specific TV show. The player has a total of 3 life points. For each wrong guess, it loses a point. If the player lost all 3 points the game is over and can be started again.
